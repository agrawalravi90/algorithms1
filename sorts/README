-- Execute the projects as follows:
-> For running only insertion sort: make insertion_sort
-> For running only selection sort: make selection_sort
-> For running only merge sort: make merge_sort
-> For running only quick sort: make quick_sort
-> For running all sorts: make run_all

-- The project currently sorts a list of 100,000 objects of class 'DummyClass' & Integer with pseudo-random values. Change the value of 'N' inside Makefile to vary this number.
-- The sorting implementations are generic and can be tested for any object type that implements 'Comparable' interface.
-- Change the parameters inside "sort.configure" file for various runtime customizations:
  -- "QUICKSORT_TO_RUN": Choose which quick sort implementation to run. use 'all' for comparing all the implementations.
  -- "DUPLICATES_ALLOWED": Choose whether to allow duplicate values in the list to sorted.
-- Performance statistics are displayed, in comparison to Java's inbuilt sorting implementation.
