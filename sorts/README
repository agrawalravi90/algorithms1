-- The client program runs various sorting implementations on a list of custom objects created from a class called "DummyClass".
-- Performance statistics are displayed, in comparison to Java's inbuilt sorting implementation.

-- Execute the projects as follows:
-> For running only insertion sort: make insertion_sort
-> For running only selection sort: make selection_sort
-> For running all sorts: make run_all

-- The project currently generates a list of 10,000 objects of class 'DummyClass' with pseudo-random values. Change the value of 'N' inside Makefile to vary this number.
-- The sorting implementations are generic and can be tested for any object type that implements 'Comparable' interface.
